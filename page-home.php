                    <h2>Our Specialty</h2>

                    <p class="blurb">A D Roofing specializes in all things roofing. We know that people are often overwhelmed when it comes to dealing with their roof. Many times the damage has snuck up on them or suddenly appears after a storm.</p>

                    <p>Without proper maintenance and inspections, roof damage can also occur without visible indications until it’s too late. Other times, the issue is complex and somewhat catastrophic. That’s why we’re here. We spend every day working around the city of El Paso to help residents resolve their roofing issues. Our experienced roofers perform all roofing repairs and maintenance needed to keep your roof secure. We perform everything from roof replacement, coating, leak repairs, inspections, gutter fixes, and more!</p>

                    <p>While we are lucky to have great weather in El Paso, having approximately 290 days of sunlight a year and moderate rain means specific maintenance and care for your roof. You don’t need much rain to cause damage to a roof. All it takes is a small amount of moisture breaking through a badly installed roof or compromised shingles. Moisture then seeps into your walls and begins to do structural damage to your home. This type of damage is generally caused by a small leak, bad flashing, and broken shingles.</p>

                    <p>Even when a storm doesn’t produce hail or rain, wind and debris can cause damage over time. El Paso is known to have some pretty heavy wind storms. Over time, this can cause damage to your roof or house.</p>

                <h3>We strive for quality, value, and honesty.</h3>

                <p>There are dozens of roofing companies in El Paso. So what sets A D Roofing apart? We take great care in doing the job right from the start. Many companies do a sloppy job, cut corners, and sacrifice quality for expediency. This often manifests in roof leaks, broken shingles, or damage soon after the work is done. Lazy roofers will do a haphazard job to collect their check and then disappear. You might not notice until the damage has spread and then becomes a hassle to deal with.</p>

                <p>At A D Roofing, we are detail oriented and meticulous because we value quality. Our goal is longevity for your roof. We only employ qualified and experienced roofers who are proficient and knowledgeable in this line of work.</p>

                <p>We are confident in all of our roof experts’ performance. That’s why we offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a ten-year labor warranty. It’s also why we do payment upon completion of our residential work. We want you to be satisfied and feel that the work you paid for was completed in a thorough and professional way.</p></div>
